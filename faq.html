Our core offerings focus on meat-based meals, and we operate in shared kitchen environments where cross-contact with allergens is possible. While we strive to maintain high food safety standards, we are unable to guarantee the absence of common allergens such as dairy, gluten, or nuts. Customers with dietary restrictions or allergies are encouraged to consult our staff for more information prior to ordering.</p>
